Until now, I didn’t have the motivation to start collecting my contents somewhere for several reasons like:
Maybe I don’t have new contents to share;
Maybe someone else already said that contents;
Maybe my contents could seem too useless;
Maybe I can be criticized for the contents I collect;
and more…
Yes, these could be true points of view but I always forgot one essential thing: what I will collect here will not be just “contents”, they will be my own “ideas”.
For sure, my ideas are not already been said, shared and even useless because they do not have any purpose. Moreover, I hope to receive criticizes and have the possibility to discuss possible improvements, why not!
On this website, I will mainly write ideas related to the field of Bioinformatics.
After this introduction, I briefly present the sections of this website
HOME: you will find this introduction (LOL);
ABOUT ME: you will find a presentation of my self (LOL2);
3LINES OF INFORMATION: you will find posts in 3 lines that contain a short piece of information;
CODE TO MYSELF: you will find some commented code;
USEFUL COMMANDS: you will find a collection of useful commands organized by packages or languages.
